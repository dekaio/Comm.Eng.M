## Chapter 2- Statistics, Probability and Noise
 * pmf is for discrete signals - value of a signal vs probability that that value would occur (1/no of times that signal value occurred)
 * pdf is for continuous signals - probability density that a signal value could be over a specified range.
### Precision and accuracy
 * Accuracy refers to how far the measurement is from the mean value- If the error is a constant, then it is an accuracy error and the device requires calibration.
 * Precision refers to how different a measurement is from its neighbouring measurements- If the error fluctuates randomly, it is a precision error, it means that there is more      random noise.
